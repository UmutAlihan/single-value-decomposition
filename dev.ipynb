This book is edited by Peter Giglio and has short stories by Joe McKinney, Gary Brandner, Henry Snider and many more. As if work wasnt already scary enough, this book gives you more reasons to be scared. Help Wanted is an excellent anthology that includes some great stories by some master storytellers.\\\\nOne of the stories includes Agnes: A Love Story by David C. Hayes, which tells the tale of a lawyer named Jack who feels unappreciated at work and by his wife so he starts a relationship with a photocopier. They get along well until the photocopier starts wanting the lawyer to kill for it. The thing I liked about this story was how the author makes you feel sorry for Jack. His two co-workers are happily married and love their jobs while Jack is married to a paranoid alcoholic and he hates and works at a job he cant stand. You completely understand how he can fall in love with a copier because he is a lonely soul that no one understands except the copier of course.\\\\nAnother story in Help Wanted is Work Life Balance by Jeff Strand. In this story a man works for a company that starts to let their employees do what they want at work. It starts with letting them come to work a little later than usual, then the employees are allowed to hug and kiss on the job. Things get really out of hand though when the company starts letting employees carry knives and stab each other, as long as it doesnt interfere with their job. This story is meant to be more funny then scary but still has its scary moments. Jeff Strand does a great job mixing humor and horror in this story.\\\\nAnother good story in Help Wanted: On The Job Terror is The Chapel Of Unrest by Stephen Volk. This is a gothic horror story that takes place in the 1800s and has to deal with an undertaker who has the duty of capturing and embalming a ghoul who has been eating dead bodies in a graveyard. Stephen Volk through his use of imagery in describing the graveyard, the chapel and the clothes of the time, transports you into an 1800s gothic setting that reminded me of Bram Stokers Dracula.\\\\nOne more story in this anthology that I have to mention is Expulsion by Eric Shapiro which tells the tale of a mad man going into a office to kill his fellow employees. This is a very short but very powerful story that gets you into the mind of a disgruntled employee but manages to end on a positive note. Though there were stories I didnt like in Help Wanted, all in all its a very good anthology. I highly recommend this book ', 'user': 'dwatson2'}\\n\"\n",

New York: Simon and Schuster/Aladdin. 336 pp. ISBN: 978-1-4424-2230-8. (Hardcover); $16.99.\\\\nKekla Magoon is an author to watch (http://www.spicyreads.org/Author_Videos.html- scroll down). One of my favorite books from 2007 is Magoons The Rock and the River. At the time, I mentioned in reviews that we have very few books that even mention the Black Panther Party, let alone deal with them in a careful, thorough way. Fire in the Streets continues the story Magoon began in her debut book. While her familys financial fortunes drip away, not helped by her mothers drinking and assortment of boyfriends, the Panthers provide a very real respite for Maxie. Sam is still dealing with the death of his brother. Maxies relationship with Sam only serves to confuse and upset them both. Her friends, Emmalee and Patrice, are slowly drifting away. The Panther Party is the only thing that seems to make sense and she basks in its routine and consistency. She longs to become a full member of the Panthers and constantly battles with her Panther brother Raheem over her maturity and ability to do more than office tasks. Maxie wants to have her own gun. When Maxie discovers that there is someone working with the Panthers that is leaking information to the government about Panther activity, Maxie investigates. Someone is attempting to destroy the only place that offers her shelter. Maxie is determined to discover the identity of the traitor, thinking that this will prove her worth to the organization. However, the truth is not simple and it is filled with pain. Unfortunately we still do not have many teen books that deal substantially with the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Black Panther Party, and the social problems in Chicago that lead to the civil unrest. Thankfully, Fire in the Streets lives up to the standard Magoon set with The Rock and the River. Readers will feel like they have stepped back in time. Magoons factual tidbits add journalistic realism to the story and only improves the atmosphere. Maxie has spunk. Readers will empathize with her Atlas-task of trying to hold onto her world. Fire in the Streets belongs in all middle school and high school libraries. While readers are able to read this story independently of The Rock and the River, I strongly urge readers to read both and in order. Magoons recognition by the Coretta Scott King committee and the NAACP Image awards are NOT mistakes!', 'user': 'edspicer'}\\n\"\n",
